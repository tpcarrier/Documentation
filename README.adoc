== Cellular IoT
EMnify is a IoT communications platform that enables you to connect your IoT solutions over the best networks in the country - anywhere with the EMnify Global IoT SIM. Not only do you get global cellular access but with our cloud-native platform, we provide you with control over your device connectivity and tools so that you can better operate and secure your solution.

- IoT SIM

Using a single SIM, you can have multiple IMSIs, switch between multiple carriers and ensure uninterrupted connectivity. You can learn more about IMSI in <<Service Stack Overview>> section

- Highly available platform

Being able to connect to multiple operators over multiple partners increases connectivity availability. EMnify's platform (consisting of a mobile core network and a communication platform dedicated for IoT) has been built up cloud-natively, which means that it is deployed in 3 cloud regions within 2-3 availability zones per region / data centers. Even when one cloud data center becomes unavailable you can still transport your data over the EMnify network.

- Cloud Integration

Given the cloud-native nature of our platform, you can easily integrate your cloud as well as on-premise IoT solutions. We allow you to connect through standard cloud services to establish a <<Cloud Connect, secure private network>> with your devices, get operational connectivity metadata delivered to your favorite << Multi Cloud Data Streamer, streaming analytics service>> or use your <<No-Code Workflow, low-code environment>>  to automate your device logistics and operation processes.

- EMnify API

With the EMnify API, you can control your SIM cards from your own applications using HTTP requests - for example to align your SIM contract with your device lifecycle, build own prepaid models or to send or receive configuration SMS. The complete functionality available is documented in the <<API Reference, API Reference>> section. 

In the following sections of the guide, you will find more information about our technology stack, integrations to several cloud platforms, the EMmnify API as well as several examples to help you in your IoT solutions building journey.

== Quickstart
To begin developing your IoT solutions with EMnify, you will need an EMnify account. link:https://portal.emnify.com/sign/up?utm_source=dev-hub[Sign up] for free to a 60-day trial to use all functionalities.

=== Order a free evaluation SIM package
Before you begin the production of your IoT solution  with your EMnify SIM cards, you may want to test the service. You can order your free Evaluation SIM package  on the EMnify portal with which you can test all EMnify services. Whereas you can download the  eSIM for your smartphone for free - shipping costs may apply for the 3 physical SIM cards, depending on your location.

=== Registering SIMs

Once you get your EMnify SIMs, you need to register them before you can start using them. 

. If you have the evaluation SIM cards, you will have to register them one by one.
+
Scan the QR code on the SIM card and click on register. The scanner will copy the BIC and take you to the EMnify portal to register the SIM.
+
image::QRScan.png[width=500, float="center"]

. If you do not have a QR reader or want to do this on a desktop without a camera, register using the BIC
+
Login to your link: https://portal.emnify.com?utm_source=dev-hub[EMnify account]
On your dashboard, click *REGISTER* on the card - Register your SIM cards.
+
image::register_sims.png[width=500, float="center"]

. Now enter the Batch Identification Code (*BIC* 1) in the prompt. You can find the BIC1 on the back of your SIM card. 
+ 
image::BIC.png[width=250, float="center"]


. If you have ordered more than 5 SIM cards, you need to batch register them using the *BIC2*.
+
image::register_batch_sim.png[width=500, float="center"]
+
image::register_sim_complete.png[width=500, float="center"]


NOTE: If you have a developer eSIM, the downloading process of an eSIM automatically registers it in our portal. 

=== Creating a Device

After you register a SIM, you need to create a virtual representation of the device associated with the SIM.

To create a device, give it a name and assign a service and coverage policy. 
// Add link to service and coverage policy

image::create_device.png[width=500, float="center"]

If you plan on using your device right away, activate it. If you do not plan on using the device right away, select "leave disabled".

=== Getting the first device online

Any device equipped with a SIM card requires an APN (Access Point Name) configuration to establish a data session. Some devices and networks auto-detect the APN but for most cases you need to configure it. 

<<APN, APN>>: `em` (or alternatively use `emnify`)

Further some Android / iOS based devices and cellular modules also need to be configured to allow for roaming. 

Select below your device type and model to see how to configure the APN.

=== Troubleshooting

When you experience issues while connecting your device for the first time there are several common patterns that can be identified by looking at the connected device section in the portal.
If you do not have any entry in the connected devices - go back to <<Creating a Device>> and assign the SIM.  

The device will show different icons that indicate the status (`Offline`, `Attached`, `Online`, `Blocked`). If no icon is visible, assign a SIM to the device. 

For most of the troubleshooting,  a look at Details->Events is necessary. 
A usual event flow should look like this:

. Update Location - the SIM card is (re)authenticating with a different network element. If successful the device will show as `Attached` and can already receive SMS. 
. Update GPRS location - the SIM card has successfully registered for data sessions with a different network element. 
. Create PDP context - the device has started a data transfer. The device will show `Online` as long is there is no delete PDP context event. 
. Delete PDP context - the device has ended a data transfer. The event details will also show the data transmitted and the device status will be set to `Offline` 

image:event_flow.png[align="center"]

There can be many update locations before or in between the data session. 

==== icon:offline[width="20"] The device is offline 

* click on Details -> ensure that the device is enabled
* click on Details ->Events. Validate if there is any location update event created and rejected. The reasoning should indicate the resolution to the problem. If there is no location update event:
* ensure the device is powered on and searches for a network
* ensure that the device is in reception of any supported network

==== icon:att[width="20"] The device shows attached but does not transmit data 

* ensure that the APN is correctly set to 'em' or use alternatively 'emnify' as some devices do not support two digit APNs. Guides for different device can be found <<here, Getting the first device online>>
* in case you changed policy settings make sure the radio types (2G,3G,4G)  and data access is activated
* ensure mobile data is enabled, as well as international roaming is allowed 
* click on Details -> Events. Validate if there is any PDP create event and rejected. The reason and resolution is given in the event description. 

NOTE: The `Attached` status does not necessarily mean that the device is powered on. If the device first attaches to a network and then powers off - there is no information towards the EMnify network that would allow to detect this.

==== icon:online[width="20"] The device shows online but does not transmit data

* ensure mobile data is enabled, as well as international roaming is allowed 
* validate under Details->Events if any `Warn` or `Error` is detected
* for NB-IoT and LTE-M this behaviour can happen when the device automatically connects to a network - rather specify the network that shall be used with using the `AT+COPS`. Also verify that the network is on EMnify's link:https://www.emnify.com/nb-iot-coverage[NB-IoT coverage] or 
link:https://www.emnify.com/lte-m-coverage[LTE-M network coverage] list
* ensure that your data destination and DNS server (default EMnify uses googles 8.8.8.8 DNS if your device does not specify a DNS) is not blocked for the device


==== Other general troubleshooting tips
* after configuration changes make sure they are correctly applied on the device (e.g. with a reboot)
* a reset connectivity icon:reset[width="20"] on Connected Devices can also reset the network state and allow your device to freshly reattach 
* the issue may only be present with one network or in the specific location (e.g. due to high interference for this network). You can use the Operator Blacklist to block the network and force the change to a different network.   


== Service Stack Overview

=== IoT SIM

EMnify IoT SIMs are more durable than regular SIM cards and come in different <<Form Factors, form factors>> and <<Quality Grades, quality grades>>. For testing the platform services quickly without any SIM hardware - EMnify offers an <<eSIM>> which can be downloaded directly onto a supported smartphone. 
EMnify also has a <<Multi-IMSI Application, multi-IMSI software application>> directly on the SIM so different operator profiles can be used based on the location of the device. Using this technology EMnify can provide a superset of roaming networks from traditional operators. 

==== Form Factors 

The traditional, plugable SIM card comes in 4 different form factors:
* 1FF (approximately the size of a credit card - only used in first GSM phones) - 85 x 54 x 0,76mm 
* 2FF (mini SIM) - 25 x 15 x 0,76mm
* 3FF (Micro SIM) - 15 x 12 x 0,76 mm
* 4FF (Nano SIM) - 12,3 x 8,8 x 0,67 mm

EMnify offers pre-punched SIM cards in different combinations  2-in-1 (1FF and 2FF), 3-in-1 (1FF,2FF,3FF) and 4-in-1 (1FF,2FF,3FF,4FF). Especially in use cases where the devices are moving it is advisable to use a SIM which exactly fits the device and does not have another smaller form factor punched-out. The SIMs are then more durable and the contact to the device is more firmly.  

Another form factor is MFF2 also called embedded SIM with the dimension 6 x 5 x 0.75-0.82mm. The embedded SIms are soldered onto a device and not removable. 

Note: Often the term eSIM is used for the MFF2 factor. Nevertheless the eSIM term is also used for SIMs whose operator profiles can be updated over the air. These eUICC based eSIM can be in any of the described form factors - not only in MFF2. While eSIM/eUICC is widely adopted for consumer smartphone and watches - for IoT use cases (where the profile cannot be download via a screen or QR reader) the commercial and deployment model of the required infrastructure prohibits an easy change of operator profiles and is therefore not widely adopted.    

==== Quality Grades

The EMnify SIM cards come in two different quality grades Commercial and Industrial. In below table a comparison to a standard consumer SIM is made.  


|===
|Parameter | Consumer SIM | Commercial  | Industrial 

|Available form factors | 2FF, 3FF, 4FF | 2FF, 3FF, 4FF | MFF2, 2FF, 3FF (2-in-1 or 3-in-1)

==== eSIM

EMnify offers an easy entry to test the services and platform by downloading an EMnify eSIM profile to an eSIM compatible phone or tablet. During the trial period every organization has the option to download one profile which can be used instantly. 

The eSIM does not use a multi-IMSI applet (as on the physical SIM cards) and therefore has some differences in the network coverage. For a list of supported devices and limitations please refer to the link:https://support.emnify.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021545600-Evaluation-eSIM-device-support-and-restrictions#h_01F7V2BVKT0RQRVXK3VNSPYQMW[knowledge base] 

The eSIM can be used to test and verify all EMnify functionalities including:

* availability of networks
* API functionality
* Cloud Connect and Datastreamer integration
* Zapier- No-Code Integrations

==== Multi-IMSI Application

EMnify IoT SIM cards are equipped with a multi-IMSI applet that contains EMnify’s own and partner operator profiles. The different operator profiles are identified by the utilized <<IMSI>>. Each IMSI / partner operator usually has more than one network accessible per country. 

The SIM applet utilizes a preferred IMSI list per country. When a device moves to a different country which has a different preferred IMSI configured (for e.g. because it gives access to more networks), then the applet dynamically overwrites the previously active IMSI with the preferred IMSI for this country. Likewise, when an operator’s service experiences outage, the SIM can automatically fall back to a fallback IMSI to ensure connection remains uninterrupted. 

The selection of the IMSI partner that is used for the countries is based on mutliple factors. The preferred IMSI selected based on: 

* allowance for permanent roaming in the country
* the most network partners in the country
* the best availability of radio access types (e.g. LTE) or availability of features (PSM/eDRX)

The Multi-IMSI applet is transparent for the device and has no impact on the device operation. In order to analyze which IMSI is currently in use, you can either check in the EMnify portal -> Connected devices -> Details or also query the device directly using the AT-command `AT+CIMI?`. 

=== Global IoT Network and Platform 

Even when IoT devices are more often only deployed at a single location and are not moving, for a vendor selling to multiple countries it is important to have a global connectivity solution, so that there is no need to have different SIM cards in stock or have multiple contracts and tariffs. For mobile use cases there is no other alternative than using an international SIM card.

Therefore, for deploying IoT solutions globally it is important to <<Mobile Network Aggregation,aggregate multiple operators>> in the same tariff with one IoT SIM. Another aspect is that the platform and data routing is setup to support a global deployment, while adhering to local data privacy regulations. EMnify's global platform therefore uses a <<Distributed Data Transport,distributed data plane>> and link:https://portal.unifiedpatents.com/patents/patent/WO-2021069322-A1[patented mechanism] called <<Regional Breakout, regional breakout>> to address these needs. 

==== Mobile Network Aggregation

Any mobile operator has a footprint of roaming networks in foreign countries. In case any of their subscribers travel, this ensures that they can be reached.  


==== Distributed Data Transport



===== Regional Breakout

===== VPN Connectivity

==== SMS

// ==== USSD

==== Voice

==== RAN Aggregation

==== Radio Access Types

The EMnify IoT SIM and platform supports all devices and modules using the following radio access technologies 

* <<2G (GSM/GPRS/Edge)>> - in more than 370 networks
* <<3G (UMTS/WCDMA/HPSA/HSDPA)>> - in more than 390 networks
* <<4G (LTE/LTE-A/LTE-CATXX)>> - in more than 310 networks
* <<5G (NR)>> - in 5+ networks
* <<LPWAN: LTE-M/NB-IoT, LTE-M (CAT-M1)>> - in more than 60 networks
* <<LPWAN: LTE-M/NB-IoT, NB-IoT (CAT-NB1, CAT-NB2)>> - in 12+ networks

When a device wants to connect with any of these radio technologies than the network needs to suport this technology as well as the device needs to support the frequency band which this network utilizes for this technology.  


===== 2G (GSM/GPRS/Edge)

GSM/GPRS is still one of the most dominant IoT technologies. Although the throughput is limited (GPRS max. 120kbps, Edge max. 1Mbps) it is more than sufficient for many IoT use cases. The modules are cheap ( <10$ ) and the coverage is widely available throughout the world in more than 200 countries. EMnify provides GSM/GPRS coverage in more than 370 GSM networks.

GSM/GPRS is easy to deploy for IoT use cases because there only 4 frequency bands utilized by operators for GSM/GPRS worldwide. 

In Americas

* B2 (1900MHz) 
* B5 (850MHz) 

In the rest of world 

* B3 (1800MHz) 
* B8 (900MHz)

Therefore, module manufacturers offer dual-band modules that can be used either in Americas or Rest of World - or Quadband modules that can be deployed globally. 

Nevertheless GSM/GPRS is being phased out in several countries to free up frequency band for newer technologies. link:https://www.emnify.com/en/resources/global-2g-phase-out[More than 60 networks have discontinued or announced to discontinue GSM technology]. 

===== 3G (UMTS/WCDMA/HPSA/HSDPA)

3G technologies like UMTS, WCDMA, HSDPA, HSUPA have been driven by the surge for more data speed. As an evolution of GSM, many parts of the GSM/GPRS core network and signaling are reused, where the most difference is in the radio part.

With more than 170 countries worldwide 3G/UMTS is still widely available. EMnify provides 3G/UMTS coverage in more than 390 networks. 

3G modules are easy to deploy - similar to 2G - as there are only 5 different frequency bands utilized by operators worlwide (with exception of Japan and China). Most UMTS modules therefore can be deployed worldwide.

* B1 (2100Mhz) - main UMTS band in the world
* B2 (1900Mhz) - used in Americas
* B4 (1700Mhz) - used in Americas
* B5 (850Mhz) - Australia / Americas
* B8 (900Mhz) - Europe 

For Europe a 900/2100 Mhz dual-band module is required.
For Americas a 850/1900 Mhz dual-band module is required. 

3G/UMTS is also being phased out by several network operators to make space for newer technologies - also check here the article on link:https://www.emnify.com/en/resources/global-2g-phase-out[GMS and UMTS networks that are being discontinued]


===== 4G (LTE/LTE-A/LTE-CATXX)

LTE is a 4G technology (another one would be Wimaxx - which never succeeded). With the evolution of LTE there have been different LTE categories established such as CAT-1, CAT-3, CAT-4, CAT-6, CAT-9, CAT-12 - mainly with increasing data throughput per category. 
While for consumer phones and broadband use cases the increase of throughput is relevant - the increasing costs for the modules have demanded for a lightweight LTE module for IoT use cases - which first led to CAT-1. 

LTE CAT-1 offers 10Mbps in downlink and 5Mbps in uplink - and is available with network operators wherever LTE is deployed. Because of its wide availability and the possibility to roam between operators without limitation LTE CAT-1 is widely used in IoT use cases.

Currently EMnify offers connectivity over LTE in more than 310 networks worldwide. 

The deployment of LTE devices in a global scale is more challenging than with GSM and UMTS because network operators worldwide have been using more than 27 different frequency bands. Most modules therefore only support specific regions where the device can be deployed.

Some main LTE-bands are

* B3 (1800 MHz) - Europe, Africa, APAC
* B7 (2600 MHz) - used in Americas, Europe, APAC
* B20 (800 MHz) - used in Europe, Asia
* B1 (2100 MHz) - Europe, Asia 
* B2 (1900 NHz) - Americas
* B4 (1700 Mhz) - Americas
* B5 (850 Mhz) - North America, APAC

TIP: Validate the frequency bands utilized by the operators in your deployment countries before deciding for a module. You can look up the utilized frequency bands link:https://www.frequencycheck.com/interfaces/lte[here] 


===== LPWAN: LTE-M/NB-IoT

While utilizing LTE infrastructure both NB-IoT and LTE-M are also part of the 5G standardization. Both technologies have been specified to meet the demand for IoT use cases in terms of: 

* Reduced cost - to enable mass production of cellular IoT devices
** removing unnecessary LTE features for IoT such as dual carrier, high modulations  
* Low power utilization - for battery powered use cases that require years of operation 
** introducing power saving features such as <<PSM>> and <<eDRX>>
** reducing the max. transmission power to less than 200mA to cater for battery max. current (GSM for example has 2A max power)
* Wider coverage - (+14dB for LTE-M and +20 for Nb-IoT sensitivity) for rural/indoor/underground use cases
** utilizing extended coverage feature with more retransmissions to ensure data gets delivered
* Smaller module size - to enable smaller device use cases

Because LTE-M and NB-IoT rely on LTE infrastructure they also utilize a multitude of different frequency bands - a total of 26 bands have been specified for their use. 
To deploy NB-IoT and LTE-M in multiple countries and regions the modules need to support the operator frequency bands. 

Cellular LPWAN modules come in different versions

* NB-IoT only or LTE-M only
* LTE-M/NB-IoT combined
* LTE-M/NB-IoT with 2G fallback and optional additional technologies (3G,4G)

As of today, roaming for NB-IoT is very limited between operators because of new charging models being implemented for NB-IoT. For LTE-M roaming usually works over regular LTE roaming - nevertheless some operators have limited the access to their LTE-M networks and the available features (PSM, eDRX).  

Check the EMnify LTE-M coverage, availability of PSM/eDRX and proposed frequency bands link:https://www.emnify.com/lte-m-coverage?hsLang=en[on our Website].

[#PSM]
Power-Save-Mode (PSM)

Jump to:

* <<PSM_CELL,Why cellular communication is not ideal for IoT>>
* <<PSM_WHAT,How does Power Save Mode work>>
* <<PSM_ROAMING, Roaming for Power Save mode>>
* <<PSM_AT_COMMANDS,AT Command calculation and examples for PSM settings>>
* 

[#PSM_CELL]
Cellular communication for smartphones usually requires low latency on downlink - in case you are being called your phone should ring right away. Because of this there are two things the device does which require power:

. continously listening to the radio if there is an incoming call
. transmitting location information to the network where it should be called - whenever it moves out of a tracking area and periodicly every 54 minutes 

[#PSM_WHAT]
For most IoT use cases a downlink-initiated channel is not required - it is usually the device that intiates the communication to send e.g. sensor data. Therefore, a Power Save Mode is introduced that allows the device to go to sleep in case it has nothing to send.

The Power Save mode has these characteristics

* the Power Save Mode is similar to a power off period during which the module only consumes a couple of &#x03BC;A
* the device tells the network for how long it is going periodically into PSM (timer T3412 extended)
* the device/module will not be reachable during PSM from the outside in downlink
* the device can wake up the module and send data (e.g. powerkey, interrupt or pin triggered)
* when the device wakes up it does not need to reattach and reestablishing a PDN connection (unless it has moved to a different tracking area)
* after the device wakes up it stays in idle mode for a configurable time (timer T3324) to listen for downlink messages (e.g. firmware updates)
* the actual time the device is then in Power Save Mode is T3412 extended - T3324

image:PSM.png[#PSM_Image].PSM and the 3412 and T3324 timers

NOTE: some modules (e.g. u-blox SARA-R4/SARA-N4) do not go into sleep mode when having a SIM enabled PIN. On EMnify SIMs the PIN is disabled. 



[#PSM_ROAMING]
Be aware that not all Nb-IoT and LTE-M networks have implemented PSM - and even when PSM is available with the local operator this does not mean that a roaming SIM can use it. This makes it very difficult for devices that are moving - in case they use PSM, and the new network does not support PSM - or only other timer configurations. We therefore regularly test the link:https://www.emnify.com/lte-m-coverage?hsLang=en[availability of PSM in our EMnify LTE-M roaming footprint.]

[#PSM_AT_COMMANDS]
The 3GPP defined AT command to configure PSM is `AT+CPSMS`m which sets the T3412 extended and T3324 timers. 

An example command is

`AT+CPSMS=1,,,01001110,00000101`

PSM will be enabled (`1`) and the desired value for T3412 extended is 140 hours (`01001110`) and the desired value for the T3324 timer is 10s (`01001110`). The network does not necessarily use the desired values but utilizes supported values that are close to the desired values. To read the effective PSM configuration use the command

`AT+CPSMS?`

There is a good calculator fon how to set the values for 3412 and T3324 available link:https://www.thalesgroup.com/en/markets/digital-identity-and-security/iot/resources/developers/psm-calculation-tool[from Thales, window=read-later]. 

Module vendors have also implemented module specific commands, e.g. Quectel

** `AT+QPSMS` extends PSM settings 
** `AT+QCFG=”psm/enter”,1` used to put the module immediately into PSM when the RRC connection is released (not waiting for T3324 to expire)
** `AT+QPSMEXTCFG` modem optimization command with different attributes such as making sure that PSM is randomized between different devices so they do not send data at the same time

[#eDRX]
extended Discontinuous Reception (eDRX)

* <<eDRX_WHAT,How does eDRX work>>
* <<eDRX_ROAMING, Roaming with eDRX>>
* <<eDRX_AT_COMMANDS,AT Command examples for eDRX settings>>

[#eDRX_WHAT]
Whereas PSM is focused on uplink centric use cases, eDRX tries to reduce the power consumption for IoT Use cases that get downlink information. Regular smartphones are not continously listening on the radio for an incoming message but only every 1.28s or 2.56s which is called DRX (discontinous Reception). eDRX allows configuration of custom intervals of up to 40-175mins - depending on which configuration the visited network allows. 

image:eDRX.png[id=PSM].PSM and the 3412 and T3324 timers

[#eDRX_ROAMING]
As with PSM - not all NB-IoT and LTE-M networks support eDRX or the same timer configuration - and even if they do this does not guarantee that a roaming SIM card can utilize eDRX. We therefore also test and link:https://www.emnify.com/lte-m-coverage?hsLang=en[publish the eDRX availability on our LTE-M roaming footprint, window=read-later].  

[#eDRX_AT_COMMANDS]

The standard 3GPP defined AT-command to configure eDRX is `AT+CEDRXS`.

As an example the below command enables (`1`) eDRX for LTE-M (`4`) and an eDRX cycle of 143.36s (`1000`).

`AT+CEDRXS=1,4,"1000"`

The setting for NB-IoT would be `5` and the timer values are shown in below table

|===
| 0 0 0 0 | 5.12 seconds  
| 0 0 1 0  | 10.24 seconds
| 0 0 1 1  | 40.96 seconds
| 0 1 0 0  | 5.12 seconds  
| 0 0 1 0  | 61.44 seconds
| 0 1 0 1  | 81.92 seconds
| 0 1 1 0  | 102.4 seconds
| 0 1 1 1  | 122.88 seconds
| 1 0 0 0  | 143.36 seconds
| 1 0 0 1  | 163.84 seconds
| 1 0 1 0 | 327.68 seconds
| 1 0 1 1 | 655,36 seconds
| 1 1 0 0 | 1310.72 seconds
| 1 1 0 1 | 2621.44 seconds
| 1 1 1 0 | 5242.88 seconds
| 1 1 1 1 | 10485.76 seconds

The network will respond with the actual effective interval. 

`+CEDRXS: [4,"1000","1000","0111"]` 

====== 5G (NR)

5G is the next major technology standard after LTE - which targets 3 different applications areas:

. enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB)
** with faster throughput upt 1Gps+ and more capacity in a local area
** utilizing mmWave bands (5Ghz+) for increased throughput
. Massive Machine Type communication (mMTC)
** targeted at IoT application where a multitude of devices are in the same location and need to communicate with low power
** LTE-M and NB-IoT often seen as decoupled from 5G to get earlier results will fusion with 5G mMTC
. Ultra Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC)
** for missing critical applications that require low latency and reliable data transmission 

As of today 5G is mainly adopted for eMBB use cases - using a 5G non-standalone (NSA) deployment - meaning that the air interface uses 5G technology whereas the core network is still 4G. 

EMnify has announced its first 5G roaming agreements in August 2020 and since then has reached agreements with more than a dozen network operators worldwide.

=== Regional Breakout
Traditional connectivity providers normally have a centrally located network core which increases network latency. 

Let's take an example of a network provider which has its network core in Ireland. And the application as well as the device that is using the nework data is in USA. This data travels from the device in USA, to the network core in Ireland and then back to the application server in USA. This geographical distance between the application server and the core network will increase the network latency. However if the network core were to be in the USA, the network latency will be lesser.

.Network Latency due to centrally located core network
image:central_core_nw.jpeg[Network Latency due to centrally located core network, 700, 300] 

EMnify's Regional Breakout is a solution for this network latency. 
Because of EMnify's globally distributed cloud architecture, you can route endpoint traffic- either dynamically depending on the device’s location or through pre-defined system configuration. 
Choosing "Regional Breakout” in your Device Service Policy will let the system dynamically choose the breakout region, based on the visited network’s location.

=== OpenVPN

EMnify's communication platform hosts a OpenVPN service, that allows to establish a private network between the device and any remote client location. The remote client can either be on the application server itself - or also on any machine that wants to remotely access the device.

==== OpenVPN Overview

To use the OpenVPN service the IoT device does not need any OpenVPN software or dynamic DNS resolution. Through the EMnify SIM every device will get a private static IP address which can be used to identify and address the device.  

You can connect from any machine using a OpenVPN client to the OpenVPN service on the EMnify communication platform. The machine can then use the private static IP address of the device to communicate with it remotely. 

.OpenVPN System Overview
image:OpenVPN.png[OpenVPN System Overview] 

At the same time the IoT device can send data through the private tunnel to the IP address of the remote machine.  

==== OpenVPN setup

In order to setup OpenVPN on your machine the following high level steps are required. 

1. In the EMnify Portal -> Device Policies: Set the service profile to a VPN breakout region, eu-west-1 (VPN)
2. Portal -> Integrations -> OpenVPN: download the VPN configuration file for your region and operating system
3. Create a credentials.txt with you username / password or organisation_id / application token.
4. load the VPN configuration file and credentials.txt with your OpenVPN client

=== Security

==== DNS

When a device establishes a connection it uses a Domain Name Service (DNS) to resolve a hostname to an IP address to which it can send data. For example a hostname such as *.iot.example.com will be mapped to the IP address e.g. 120.126.230.60. 

The device itself can configure a DNS service that it uses to resolve domain names. If the device does not use a DNS then EMnify will provide a domain name service to the device. By default EMnify will route all DNS queries over Google's public DNS `8.8.8.8`. 

Customers can also configure to use their own DNS - no matter if it is a public or a private one.
The DNS settings can be changed in the Portal -> Device Policies -> Service Policies -> More Options -> DNS

image:dns_setting.png[].Custom DNS setting configuration


Utilizing a private DNS server which is not reachable via a public IP, requires to setup a private network with the machine or a network where the private DNS is located. This can be done using Cloud Connect either with Amazon Transit Gateway or IPsec.
